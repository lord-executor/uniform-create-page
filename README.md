# Kirby CMS Uniform Create Page Action
This is a [Kirby CMS](https://getkirby.com/) plugin for the [Uniform plugin](https://github.com/mzur/kirby-uniform) (yes, this is basically a plugin-plugin) which adds a form action that creates a Kirby page from the submitted form data.

## Installation

### Using the KirbyCLI
```bash
kirby plugin:install lord-executor/uniform-create-page
```

### Manually
Get the plugin files by downloading a ZIP archive of the source from https://github.com/lord-executor/uniform-create-page or by cloning the repository with
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lord-executor/uniform-create-page.git
```

Then, copy all the files into your Kirby installation's `site/plugins` directory under a newly created `uniform-create-page` directory.

**Note** that the plugin directory _must_ be named `uniform-create-page` and it _must_ directly contain the `uniform-create-page.php` file.
